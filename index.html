            <h2> About Me</h2>
            <p> Hey everyone. My name is <b>Gauri Ramesh</b> and I'm a student at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln majoring in Computer Science, with minors in Math and Business. I decided to make this website as a personal project over the summer of 2017 so I could learn more about web development. I'm trying to get my feet wet in everything so I can figure out what direction I want to take my computer science career in. </p>
            <p> In my free time, I like to play the piano, write, read, and spend time with my friends and family. I also enjoy coaching high school speech and reading the news. </p>
            <p> I'm really passionate about people. As part of my long term career plans, I want to be a driving force in closing the gender gap in technology. Along with being a developer, I also would love to teach and work with kids to get them excited about technology and what they can do with it in the future. </p>
